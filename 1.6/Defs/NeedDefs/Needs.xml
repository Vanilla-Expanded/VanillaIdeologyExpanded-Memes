    <label>anonymity</label>
    <description>Anonymity reflects on how secretive a person finds their identity and personality to be. A pawn with this belief will feel happier when it’s high and unhappy when it’s nearing depletion. Anonymity slowly rises over time and any social interaction or exposed facial features will lower it.</description>

    <label>corruption</label>
    <description>Corruption reflects a person's desire to give in to the dark, eldritch, and possibly even violent desires deeply embedded within them; a mildly corrupt pawn cannot lose ideological certainty. Corruption slowly fades daily, but can be paused by nearby obelisks and increased by incantation rituals. Upon reaching 100 corruption a pawn will immediately begin mentally breaking, and upon reaching 0 a pawn will easily be swayed to any other ideoligion</description>
